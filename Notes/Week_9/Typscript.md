## **Typescript basics to advance**

### Strongly Typed vs Loosely Typed.&#x20;

The term strongly tylped and loosely typed refer to howe programming languages handle tylpes, particularly how strict they are about type conversion and type safety.&#x20;

| Strongly Typed                        | Loosely Typed                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| lesser runtime errors                 | easy to write code.                                       |
| stricter codebase                     | fast to bootstrap                                         |
| Explicit                              | Implicit (Type Coercion)                                  |
| easy to catch errors at compile type. | Can be challenging (runtime errors) - low learning curve. |
| Eg: Java, C++, C, Rust                | Eg: Python, Javascript, perl, php                         |

People realised that js ia a very power language, but lacks types, Typescript was introduced as a new language add types on top of js.&#x20;
