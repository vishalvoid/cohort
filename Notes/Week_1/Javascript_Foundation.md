## **Javascript Foundation** and Basics.

***

### 1. Why Languages ?&#x20;

Whenever you Executes something goes into the ram. What goes into the ram -> not C++ codes not any sourcecode. -- our hardware read high level code. with the help of *compilers*. which will convert high level code into Zero's and One's. (011001010...).&#x20;

Languages are required to make a conversation between us (humans) and machines. because computer only understands 010010101. and we speak english, hindi, french. so we needed some common language. wo make it work.

> *   Languarges are used to write qpplications.
>
> *   Developers write high level code in these languages.
>
> *   Every language has a compiler which converts the developer code into 0110011p0

### 2. Interpreted vs compiled Languages.&#x20;

What are Compilers? : Compilers convert high level developer friendly code into 0s and 1s. (c++ compiler is called g++)&#x20;

There are three Steps require to run a c++ code code. which is **`compiled.`** &#x20;

1.  Writing a code.

2.  Compiling a Code.&#x20;

3.  Running the code (Putting it into ram)

There will be only two Steps while running a javascript code which is `Interpreted`

1.  writing a code.

2.  Running a code.

> Unlike c++ it does not compiled the whole code. then run it. Javascript compiles every line and then it runs. so every line which is written in js. get's comverted into 0s and 1s. then it runs.&#x20;
>
> eg: for a 10 line js program. it will run 10 lines saparately.

| Compiled Languages                                      | Interpreted Languages                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| First need to compile, then need to run.                | Usually go line by line.                   |
| Usually don't compile if there is an error in the code. | Can run partially if the error comes later |
| Example - C++, Java, Rust, Golang                       | Example - Javascript, Python               |

### 3. Why JS? >> Other Languages in some use cases.&#x20;

Browsers can only understand HTML / CSS / JS (not technically true ) - browsers can understand other languages like c++, rust, java and others. b;ut js is mandatory.

> Thanks to node.js. now js can be used for "Backend Development"

### 4. Strict vs dynamic languages.

### 5. Single threaded nature of JavaScript.

### 6. Simple primitives in JS( number, string, booleans)

### 7. Complex primitives in JS ( arrays, objects )

### 8. Functions in Javascript

### 9. Practise Problem Solving

### 10. Callback functions, Event loop, callback queue, Asynchronous Programing

### 11. Callback hell and Promises
